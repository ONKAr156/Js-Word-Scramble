## Things Learned 🧠

The development of this project led to the discovery and reinforcement of several important JavaScript concepts:

1. **Math.floor()**: Used to round down a number to the nearest integer, crucial for generating random indices.

2. **Math.random()**: Employed to generate random decimal numbers, enabling the shuffling of letters.

3. **split('')**: Dividing a string into an array of characters, which is essential for scrambling words.

4. **setInterval() & clearInterval()**: Leveraged for managing the game timer, creating a sense of urgency.

5. **querySelector()**: Utilized to select HTML elements with CSS-style selectors, aiding in dynamic updates.
